# Contributing to the FunBlocks project

If you are reading this, you are part of the best! Contributions are of course more than welcome, on any part of the FunBlocks project.
Contributions don't have to be about code only.
Bug reporting and suggestions for improvement are also great ways to get involved.

## Contributing Code

Before starting on a journey to refactor half of the source code, be sure to check the issue to see if the feature you plan has already been discussed.
If not, open your own issue so that your contribution may integrate nicely with the project.
Plan on small incremental changes, so that your contribution has less risk being in conflict with other development.

When your contribution is ready, go over the following steps as you open your pull request:

* Ensure that your code compiles completely on your machine.
* List all changes you have done and use them to describe your pull request.

### Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, be sure to first check the issues to avoid creating duplicates.
If nobody reported the bug you experienced, feel free to open an issue with as much information as possible.
In particular, be sure to include:

* A concise description of the problem you experienced.
* Whenever possible, the steps to reproduce the bug you experienced.
* A description of the web browser you use.
  There are multiple websites that can give you a complete description of your browser (e.g. https://www.whoishostingthis.com/tools/user-agent/).

### Suggesting Improvements

Just as for bug reports, be sure to first check the issues to see if you suggestion was already made.
If not, simply open one.
Try to motivate your suggestions with examples, ideally demonstrating how it is an improvement on the current version.
